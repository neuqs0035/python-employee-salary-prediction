# python-employee-salary-prediction

üöÄ Predict employee salaries using this Python-based machine learning code. The model factors in years of experience, education level, and job title for accurate estimations.

## Overview

This Python-based machine learning code predicts employee salaries based on years of experience, profession code, and education level. The model employs the scikit-learn library and a linear regression algorithm.

## Benifits

1. üéØ Accurate Salary Estimations: Leverage machine learning to make accurate predictions based on relevant factors like years of experience, profession code, and education level.

2. üîç Data-Driven Decision Making: Use existing employee data to inform hiring decisions and ensure fair and competitive salary offers.

3. üìà Evaluation Metrics: Assess the model's performance with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) for confidence in predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html): Install using pip

    ```bash
    pip install -U scikit-learn
    ```

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html): Install using pip

    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/): Install using pip

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhavya416/python-employee-salary-prediction.git
    cd python-employee-salary-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dataset (`Salary_Data.csv`) in the same directory.

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python Main.py
    ```

3. View the predicted salary and evaluation metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average absolute errors between predicted and actual salaries.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared differences between predicted and actual salaries.
- **R-squared (R2):** Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (salary) that is predictable from the independent variables.
